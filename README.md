# CFG Cloud & Deployment Challenge
In this repo, my group and I attempted to solve the CFG Cloud & Deployment MOOC Challenge for a dog social network startup. We acted as Cloud Consultants and advised our recommended cloud & deployment option for the company. We used our knowledge from the course, along with our own research to answer the questions set out in the challenge.

Our team consisted of:
- Anne Ainsworth
- Betul Bakir
- Cylinta Hasfal
- Denise Chan
- Tasnia Islam

We were selected as one of the three finalist and were asked to present our solution as Cloud Consultants. Anne and I presented on presentation night, you can watch our presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/NfZMO393HnA?feature=share&t=898).

You can find our slide deck [here](docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c-zm2PHUevwPB99Iab9z8qbT19zOWT66N3mdJXCnTyo/edit?usp=drive_link).
